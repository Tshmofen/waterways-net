# Waterways .NET (Godot 4.0+)

It is a port to `Godot 4.0+`/`.NET` of a tool to generate river meshes with flow and foam maps based on bezier curves.  
Visit the original page for all the info about setting it up and instructions on how to use it: [https://github.com/Arnklit/Waterways](https://github.com/Arnklit/Waterways).  
I didn't change any functionality and everything should be working the same (though, might be altered later to support my own needs, I will update info if it happens).  

Some Context
---
I needed some light and convenient river system for my own lil project, but the last version of this (and the only) one was only for `Godot 3.5`.  
So, I just took it in my hands, and ported the functionality for `Godot 4`, in the mean time completely rewriting it in C# (Because - why not?) 

I really appreciate the convinience and performace of C# over GDScript (considering my little bit of disslike for any python-like dynamic languages).  
So, here we are, feel free to use that version of the plugin without any additional license applied (except for the original one, unfortunately) and just enjoy this cool plugin. 

I may be back later to refactor it more or adapt for my needs, so stay tuned.  
Well, I don't think it's gonna be in the original repo, as it's not really in the scope of it, so here we are with a separate one.

Issues
---
Obviously, as it is a rewrite for another language, it may have introduced a few new bugs, just create issues here if anything happens, and I will see what I can do.
